# streamplace-card

this project will use [mental poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_poker) algorithms (specifically, the ed25519 operations provided by [ssb-keys](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-keys)) to implement a decentralized peer-to-peer battle card game conceptually similar to Magic: The Gathering or Hearthstone.
