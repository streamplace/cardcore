# cardcore

this project uses [mental poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_poker) algorithms (specifically, the ed25519 operations provided by [@streamplace/ssb-keys](https://github.com/ssbc/@streamplace/ssb-keys)) to implement a decentralized trading card game conceptually similar to magic: the gathering or hearthstone.

## development

```
yarn install
npm run start
